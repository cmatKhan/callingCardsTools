# Calling Cards Tools

This package is intended to provide both command line utilities as well as 
useful objects for the processing and analysis of Calling Cards sequencing 
data.  

This document (will eventually) provides both user and developer documentation. The intent of the 
developer documentation is to provide both an overview of the package structure, 
and also provide some tips on using vscode and the test suite to explore and 
hopefully expand the functionality.
